GitHub Issues Voter is a progressive web app that allow you to upvote or downvote to any issues you interested.

This web app is built with Polymer and Firebase.

### Why GitHub Issues Voter

First, I don't like the design of github.com. I am a huge fans of Material Design. This is the main reason why I implement Material Design on this web app. Now, it's looks nicer and responsive.

Second, it's quite hard to "support" an issues in order to bring the attention of the repo's owner. I bring this upvote and downvote system to my webapp.

Third, I need to create something in order to join and win this hackathon. And this is why I am building this awesome web app.
